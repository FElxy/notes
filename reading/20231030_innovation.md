Three things about innovation

New approaches(方法) will never be embraced by everyone at first. If you need unanimous([jʊˈnænəməs]全体一致的; 一致同意的，无异议的) consent, you’re not going to move forward.

Finally, it’s not sure to work.

If you need any or all three of these things for your project to move forward, you probably should pick a different project.
