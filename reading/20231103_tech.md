Commonplace technology
 "常见技术" 或 "普通技术"。
Not all tech is new tech.

The ballpoint pen was a revelation（天启，启示; 揭发，暴露; 被揭露出来的事物; 意外的发现）, and a bit controversial（争议）. Now, it’s disposable and obvious.
圆珠笔曾经是一个革命性的发明
现在，它已经成为了一种一次性产品，显而易见。

Different industries go through tech spurts. 
不同的行业都会经历技术飞跃。

My desk is covered with items I use every day (a mouse, headphones, a solid-state drive（固态硬盘）, transparent tape, and even a Star Trek communicator《星际迷航》通讯器) that were risky breakthroughs, and now they are simply commonplace (though we now call the communicator a phone).

When tech is coming at us too quickly, it’s tempting to simply wait. It’s risky to be an early adopter.
当技术以过快的速度涌入时，很容易选择观望。成为早期采用者是有风险的。

But once the pace slows down a bit, once our peers and competitors are benefitting from a productivity breakthrough, 
our aversion should be more intentional than that. 
我们的拒绝应该更加有意义。
Perhaps it’s time to reconsider the tech we once said we were too busy to bother learning.

We get to choose our tools, and the tools we choose alter the work we do.
