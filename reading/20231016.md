Different kinds of people
It’s a tempting(吸引人的; 诱人的) shortcut(捷径，近路; 被切短的东西; 快捷键).

Different kinds of people prefer pop tarts(一种甜点，通常由两片薄饼之间夹有果酱或其他甜馅料制成。) to pizza, or prefer expensive wine to beer, or prefer amusement parks to bowling.

```"prefer... to..." 的翻译是 "更喜欢...而不是..."，它用于表示对两种或多种选择之间的偏好。```

Except(可是) everyone is the same and everyone is different.

What’s actually useful is to realize that in this moment, under these conditions, this person and people who have this person’s preferences, will often choose a certain path.

When groups of people with a shared preference or attitude choose to do something, we see markets and cultural trends.

But these people aren’t different kinds. They’re simply people responding or reacting to what’s on offer. This means that people can have different responses based on different offers and different conditions. We’re not stuck forever, simply grooved into certain patterns.

```"grooved into" 在上下文中表示人们不是永远被固定在某种模式或方式中，而是被塑造成适应特定模式或方式的倾向。这里的 "grooved" 意味着习惯或定势。这个短语的翻译可以是 "被塑造成"、"被习惯于"、"被定势为" 等，具体取决于上下文。```
