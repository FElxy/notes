The first nine minutes
Mixing up a batch of homemade vegan(素食的) marshmallow(棉花糖) Fluff® is an exercise in patience.

For the first nine minutes of the ten minutes it takes in the mixer, not much happens. And then, it transforms into something fluffy(松软的) and delightful.

Without the recipe, it’s unlikely that most folks would make it to minute five, never mind ten.

Knowing it can be done makes it far more likely we’re going to stick it out and do it again.
